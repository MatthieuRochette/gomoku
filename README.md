### Gomoku AI brain based on the [Piksvork](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/piskvork/code/trunk/source/doc/protocl2en.htm) protocol

This is a 3rd year project at Epitech, in the Artificial Intelligence module.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Pip installed
- Piskvork-based manager program (download official version [here](https://gomocup.org/download-gomocup-manager/) (Windows))

### Common

- Download or clone this repository
- Open a terminal inside the repository

### On windows

- Execute the command `python compile.py`. It creates an executable at the root of the repository.
- You can choose to copy or move the created executable file wherever you want, or leave it there.
- Open Piskvork, and go to `Players > Preferences` in the top menu (or press F4), and change one of the players to Computer and set the path to the executable you created before.
- (Alternative to Piskvork) You can launch the program in a terminal, but it's less enjoyable.

### On linux
Two options:  
- Just run `python3 main.py` at the root of the repo  
  
or  
  
- Run `make`, which will create an executable copy of main.py, and pass this copy's path to your piksvork manager program.
